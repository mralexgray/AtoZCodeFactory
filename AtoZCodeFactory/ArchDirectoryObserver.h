/*
Suppose you want to observe your app's template folder, and you already have a function that returns it:

NSURL * MyTemplateFolderURL() {
    return [MyApplicationSupportDirectoryURL() URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"Templates" isDirectory:YES];
}
To begin observing, add one of your objects as an observer of the directory:

NSURL * templatesURL = MyTemplateFolderURL();
[templatesURL addDirectoryObserver:self options:0 resumeToken:nil];
Then implement three methods:

- (void)observedDirectory:(NSURL*)observedURL childrenAtURLDidChange:(NSURL*)changedURL historical:(BOOL)historical resumeToken:(ArchDirectoryObservationResumeToken)resumeToken {
    NSLog(@"Files in %@ have changed!", changedURL.path);
}

- (void)observedDirectory:(NSURL*)observedURL descendantsAtURLDidChange:(NSURL*)changedURL reason:(ArchDirectoryObserverDescendantReason)reason historical:(BOOL)historical resumeToken:(ArchDirectoryObservationResumeToken)resumeToken {
    NSLog(@"Descendents below %@ have changed!", changedURL.path);
}

- (void)observedDirectory:(NSURL*)observedURL ancestorAtURLDidChange:(NSURL*)changedURL historical:(BOOL)historical resumeToken:(ArchDirectoryObservationResumeToken)resumeToken {
    NSLog(@"%@, ancestor of your directory, has changed!", changedURL.path);
}
When you're done observing, make sure you remove the observer:

NSURL * templatesURL = MyTemplateFolderURL();
[templatesURL removeDirectoryObserver:self];
Resume Tokens

ArchDirectoryObserver exposes the powerful FSEvents capability to observe changes that occurred in the past, when the app was not running.

This ability is used through the resumeToken: parameters to various methods. Each observation is associated with a resume token; if you later register an observer with that resume token, observation will resume from the moment after that change. That means you can save your last resume token to disk before quitting and then add the observer again with that resume token the next time you need it. In so doing, you can learn about changes that happend when your app wasn't running.

Resume tokens can be written to a property list or an NSCoder archive, so they're easy to save.

Options

You can tweak the way ArchDirectoryObserver observes your directory with two options:

ArchDirectoryObserverObservesSelf: By default, you won't observe changes made by your own process. Pass this parameter if you really do want to see them.

ArchDirectoryObserverResponsive: The default behavior does not notify you immediately of changes; it waits a few seconds and coalesces similar changes to avoid overwhelming your app with observations. This kind of lag isn't very good where the user can see it, though. This flag changes the coalescing algorithm to one that immediately notifies you of the first change and only coalesces subsequent changes.
